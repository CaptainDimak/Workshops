## Arduino Barebones

![Checklist](Images/breadboard.png)

Have you ever wanted to create your own device using an Arduino microcontroller but without having to rely on the Uno board? 

Arduino Bare Metal workshop is all about taking the ATMega328P microcontroller (Arduino Uno brain) out of the Arduino Uno board, into a breadboard and addint the bare minimum set of components to get it working just like an Arduino.

This will allow you to better understand how a Microcontroller works and will give you the confidence to create your own projects! 

In this workshop we will cover:

- Assemble a bare metal circuit using a breadboard (like the one in the picture)
- Loading the bootloader into the microcontroller chip (DEMO)
- Understand the difference between SPI and UART interfaces (when to use each when interfacing with Microcontrollers to load your sketch)
- Load sketches to your board
- Alternatives for powering your bare metal circuit and tradeoffs
- Debug the circuit and common troubleshooting scenarios

Parts needed:

- Microcontroller ATMEGA 328PU - [link to Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATMEGA328P-PU/ATMEGA328P-PU-ND/1914589)
- 2 x 22pF capacitor
- 3 x 100nF capacitor
- 1 x 16Mhz Crystal Oscilator 
- 1 x Red LED 5mm
- 1 x 330R resistor
- 1 x 10K resistor
- 1 x tactile push button
- 1 x CP2102 USB to Serial board like [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32650897782.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dvrcU1W)
- 1 x Full size breadboard
- Breadboard wire kit
- If you want ot be able to burn the bootloader into your ATMEGA 328, you'll also need an AVR Programmer (recommend getting [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825) one.)
