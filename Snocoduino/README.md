## Workshops at Snoco Makerspace

This is the main repo for all my workshop collateral. Here, you'll find for each workshop I host: 

- Classroom collateral
- Pre-workshop checklist
- Sample Code
- Assembly Instructions
- BOM (bill of material)
- Schematics
- Link to Easy EDA so you can copy and modify schematics and PCB
- Parts Design
- Link to OnShape so you can copy and modify 3D designs
- Addtional information

## Where can I find the workshop schedule?

At Snoco Makerspace we use Meetup to schedule all out Workshops. Please visit the link below to find the most updated information:

## Which workshop shoul I attend first?

You may attend workshops in any order, however, to maximize your learning experience some workshops should be taken in a specific order and others have pre-requisites. It all depends on your previous knowledge and interest for some specific topic. 

We recommend taking the workshops in the following sequence:

 ![Learning Path](Images/path.png)

## Arduino 101

Where everything starts. In the first workshop you’ll learn how to connect an Arduino board to your PC, program it and control electronic components using code! Impossible not to fall in love. 

## Electronics 101

Learn how to use a multimeter to measure power and components, a breadboard, the process to add new modules and components to the Arduino and expand the complexity of your projects. 

## Arduino Baremetal

How about creating your own project, without having to use an Arduino board? In this workshop you’ll learn how to take an ATMega328P (brain of the Uno) and get it to work in a breadboard. 

## PCB Design

Got your project up and running in a breadboard? This workshop is all about making it look professional and get a PCB (printed circuit board) done. Includes the schematics and the PCB design and good practices.

## SMD Soldering

Once you decide to move away from the breadboard, and design your own PCB, it is very likely you’ll use SMD components. In this workshop you’ll learn how to build and replace SMD components in a board

## Logic analyzer

Testing and troubleshooting more advanced circuits is hard. Buying an Oscilloscope might be an overkill, so come and learn how a Logic Analyzer can help you to understand, study and fix your projects!
